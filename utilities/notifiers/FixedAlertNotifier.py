Dear Observers,

%s's fixed session, whose periods runs from %s
through %s, has one or more periods blacked out.
As a result these periods will not be scheduled.
At this point three options are available:

     (1) Change one or more blackout dates affecting the project
         so that this situation is remedied.
     (2) Leave all blackout dates as they are, and accept that your
         project will not be scheduled.  In this case the period
         *will not be rescheduled*.
     (3) Contact the GBT scheduling team (helpdesk-dss@nrao.edu) to
         determine if the parameters for this project should
         be changed.    

Regards,

The GBT scheduling team
