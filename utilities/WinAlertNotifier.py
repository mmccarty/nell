Dear Observers,

%s's windowed session, whose window runs from %s through
%s, is blacked out for >%s%% of its possible scheduling time.
As a result it is %s this project will not be scheduled
during its window.  At this point three options are available:

     (1) Change one or more blackout dates affecting the project

     (2) Leave all blackout dates as they are, and accept that your project
         may not be scheduled.  In this case the window *will not be
         rescheduled*.
     (3) Contact the GBT scheduling team (helpdesk-dss@nrao.edu) to determine
         if the window parameters for this project should be changed.    

Regards,
