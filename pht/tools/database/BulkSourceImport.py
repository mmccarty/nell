    Responsible for loading Source objects into the PHT via a text file.

    Each line of the file should follow the format:
    SourceName; Group Names; Coordinate System; Equinox; Longitude; Latitude; Ref Frame; Convention; Velocity;

    For example:
    NGC3242; PNe; Equatorial; J2000; 10:24:46.1; -18:38:32; Barycentric; Optical; 4.70;
    NGC3242 ; PNe ; Equatorial ; J2000 ; 10:24:46.1 ; -18:38:32 ; Barycentric ; Optical ; 4.70;
    NGC3242 Pos1; G1, G2, G3; Equatorial; J2000; 10:24:46.1; -18:38:32; Barycentric; Optical; 4.70;
