    Calculating the Fraction of Time Going Against Different Weather Categories
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The weather group is determined by receiver:
KFPA, MBA and W are in the excellent weather group.
X, Ku, Ka and Q are in the good weather group.
All others (342, 450, 600, 800, 1070, L, S, and C) are in the poor
weather group.

Let g be the fraction of windowed session that are observed away from their
default date.  (These are the sessions that get moved to poor weather days.)
The value of g is an input parameter for a whole semester.  The value of
g is between 0.0 and 1.0.  This value will need to be a parameter we 
input for a given semster.

Let f_poor, f_good and f_excellent be the fraction of time available for 
each weather group.  We get to set what these fractions are for a given
semester and the values are between 0.0 and 1.0.

An elective session will have m observations occur within n days.  The
fraction of observations occuring in the proper weather conditions is
given by h, were

h = (1 - m/n)


T_i is determined from the LST Pressure Calculation formula.

For weather monitoring sessions with widows less than or equal to 3 days:
T_poor_i = T_i * f_poor
T_good_i = T_i * f_good
T_excellent_i = T_i * f_excellent

For monitoring sessions with windows greater than 3 days:
T_poor_i = T_i * g  +  T_i * f_poor * (1 - g)
T_good_i = T_i * f_good * (1 - g)
T_excellent_i = T_i * f_excellent * (1 - g)


For poor weather elective sessions:
T_poor_i = T_i * h  +  T_i * f_poor * (1 - h)
T_good_i = T_i * f_good * (1 - h) 
T_excellent_i = T_i * f_excellent * (1 - h)

For good weather elective sessions:
T_good_i = T_i * h + T_i * f_good * (1 - h) / (f_good + f_excellent)
T_excellent_i = T_i * f_excellent * (1 - h) / (f_good + f_excellent)

For excellent weather elective sessions:
T_excellent_i = T_i

For open sessions the time should go only to the weather condition 
set for the session in the GB PHT.

For poor weather fixed sessions:
T_poor_i = T_i * f_poor
T_good_i = T_i * f_good
T_excellent_i = T_i * f_excellent

For good weather fixed sessions:
T_good_i = T_i * f_good / (f_good + f_excellent)
T_excellent_i = T_i * f_excellent / (f_good + f_excellent)

For excellent weather fixed sessions:
T_excellent_i = T_i


For all sessions:
If the time in poor weather for sessions given a Group A ranking exceeds
the time available in a semester for the poor weather then the amount of
time exceeding the poor weather semester time will count against good
and excellent weather in the ratio of f_good and f_excellent.  For example
if T_poor_i = 1000 and T_poor_available_i = 600 then the extra 400 hours 
is split amongst T_good_availabe_i and T_excellent_available_i.  The fraction
going to the good weather is determined by

(T_poor_i - T_poor_available_i ) * f_good / (f_good + f_excellent)

and the fraction going to excellent weather is determined by

(T_poor_i - T_poor_available_i ) * f_excellent / (f_good + f_excellent)

The faction of poor weather time is then capped at

T_poor_i = T_poor_available_i

Again, note that this is only for time assigned to Group A.
