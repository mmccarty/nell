"""CNF  maps a parse tree of a proposition into its conjunctive-normal form.

   INPUT FORMAT: a parse tree (nested list) of this format:

   L ::=  [ op, L, L ]  |  [ "-", L ]  |  "p"
          where op is any of  "&", "|", "->"
                p  is a string of letters

  Here are examples:
      ["&", ["|", "p", "q"], "r"]
      ["-", ["->", "p", ["-", "s"]]]
      ["-", ["-", "p"]]
      ["->", "a", "b"]
      "p"

   If the input nested list does _not_ match the above format, 
   the program will crash!

   OUTPUT FORMAT: a nested listed representation of the tree's cnf:

     C ::=  [ D1, D2, ... Dn ]
     D ::=  [ F1, F2, ... Fm ]
     F ::=  "p"  |  "-p"
            where  p  is a string of letters

   Example: the cnf,   (p | q | -r) & (s) & (-p | s),  is presented as the
   nested list,        [["p", "q", "-r"], ["s"], ["-p", "s"]]


   The conversion of a tree into CNF uses the algorithm in the lecture notes,
   Chapter 5.
