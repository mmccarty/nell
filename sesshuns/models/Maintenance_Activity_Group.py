# Maintenance_Activity_Group is a collection points for all
# maintenance activities contemplated for a single maintenance period.
# When future maintenance periods take the form of pending periods or
# electives their exact date is not known.  It is not even known if
# one will precede another.  So the system creates as many
# Maintenance_Activity_Groups as there are possible maintenance
# activity dates for that week, labeling them 'A', 'B', etc.  It is
# guaranteed that 'A' will be then attached to the earliest
# maintenance date, 'B' to the next one, etc.
#
# The following is a use case, assuming 2 maintenance days denoted by
# equal electives (date range exactly the same: Tuesday-Friday).
#
#   1) The system sees the two electives for that week.  It then
#   creates (as needed) 2 Maintenance_Activity_Groups, labeling one
#   'A' and the other 'B'.  It does nothing if they are already
#   created.  It truncates the list if the number of elective
#   maintenance electives decreased, deleting the lowest rank ('A' is
#   highest).  It increases the list if the number of maintenance
#   electives increased.  Deletions of Maintenance_Activity_Groups are
#   'soft', enabling the administrators to restore them or the
#   activities attached to them.
#
#   2) These are now be displayed on the calendar in order, on the
#   Monday of the week, where maintenance personnel can attach
#   activities to them.  They are not attached to any periods yet.
#
#   3) The scheduler schedules one of the electives.
#
#   4) The calendar notes this and attaches group 'A' to the published
#   period.
#
#   5) The scheduler schedules the second one, at a date that comes
#   after the first one.
#
#   6) The calendar notes this and attaches group 'B' to the published
#   period.
#
#       ---OR---
#
#   5) The scheduler schedules the second one, but on a date that
#   comes before the first scheduled elective.
#
#   6) The calendar notes that 'B' will come before 'A', and swaps the
#   two.  Now 'A' is attached to the earlier date, and 'B' to the
#   later date.
#
#   7) Maintenance_Activity_Groups remain attached to periods even
#   after periods are published.  This allows the calendar to maintain
#   this 'A', 'B' ... ordering even if the scheduler alters the date
#   of an already published period.
