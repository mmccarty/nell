      <li><a name="HelpDesk">Is there a helpdesk for the DSS?</a>
        <ul>
          <li>The DSS team has set up a supoort center to provide assistance.  You can <a href="https://help.nrao.edu">login</a> into the support center.  The support center tracks each submission with a unique ticket number.  You can expect a timely response.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a name="BackupProjects">What is a backup project?</a></li>
        <ul>
	      <li>Backup projects are observing projects that can be called on to fill cancellations in the GBT schedule.  They are essential to the smooth operation of the Dynamic Scheduling System (DSS).  Should the GBT site have unexpected weather changes, hardware failures, or some other event affeting the fixed schedule, backup projects will be called to fill the time on short notice in order to avoid dead time.
          <li>Backup projects come in two different flavors. "Operator-run" backup projects are those which may be run by the operator without assistance from the project PI.  Having a project selected as an operator-run project requires that it meet a set of strict conditions.  "Observer-run" backup projects are the second type.  These are projects for which the PI or contact observer has volunteered to be on call at short notice. Volunteers for this type of project should be prepared to observe with as little as 15 minutes notice. Please note that volunteering for this type of observation does not handicap your chances of getting regular observing time. You are volunteering to make yourself available at short-notice <i>in addition</i> to regular observations.
	      <li>More information can be found on backup projects and the criteria that need to be fulfilled in order for your project to be considered for this status in the DSS Observers Introduction.
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a name="HowBackupProjects">How can I get my project listed as a backup project?</a>
        <ul>
	      <li>Contact your project "friend." This person is your primary contact for all questions regarding your observing and they can assist you with nearly all observing decisions relating to the Green Bank site and telescopes. In the case of "observer-run" backups, the process is simple. You simply need to make your request known to the project friend and they will forward your wishes to the DSS. Please note that for obvious reasons, it is <i>essential</i> to keep your contact information up-to-date.  You can see your contact information on the <a href="http://dss.gb.nrao.edu"> DSS webpage</a>.
         </li>
          <li>If you think that your project is suitable for consideration as an "operator-run" project then, again, inform your project friend. There are several factors to consider before any project can be placed into the operator-run pool. See the DSS Observers Introduction. Your project friend will discuss the requirements of your project with you and help you decide if it is suitable for this status. If your project is deemed suitable then it will be placed on the backup list available to the telescope operators.

      <li><a name="firstcontact">How do I note which investigator should be contacted first?</a>
        <ul>
          <li>The list of observers who are associated with your project is kept on your Project page. Here you can rearrange the order of the observes listed.  The observer at the top of the list will be the first one contacted.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a name="remoteobserving">How can I become qualified as a remote observer?</a>
        <ul>
          <li>To be qualified for remote observing, observers are first required to have at least one observing run and training session at the Green Bank site, under the guidance of GBT staff.  Full requirements and guidelines for remote observing may be found <a href="http://www.gb.nrao.edu/gbt/remoteobserving.shtml">here</a>.
          </li>
          <li> We stress that only Green Bank staff may give permission for remote observing.  Students must be trained by GBT staff, not off-site by advisors.
          </li>
          <li>Observers who were qualified as remote observers before the implementation of the DSS are still considered qualified. At present there is no time limit placed on this status, though observers are expected to visit the site when using instruments or observing modes unfamiliar to them. If you think that you may need assistance during your observations then please plan on coming to Green Bank for your observations.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a name="FixedSession">What is a fixed session?</a>
        <ul>
          <li>Some Telescope Periods must be observed at a specific date and time. For example, a VLBI run or a radar run must observe at a specific time.  These observations are not suitable for dynamic scheduling, so they are simply put into the telescope schedule at the required time and other observations are fitted around them. These periods are known as "fixed sessions."
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a name="Investigators">What if one of my Project's 'Observers' is a collaborator, but won't be observing?</a>
        <ul>
          <li>The list of observers for your project is in your control.  There is a checkbox on the DSS project page that indicates whether each investigator is an observer.  Those not identified as observers do not need to enter blackout dates and will not get called for scheduling news.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a name="iCalHowToProject">What is iCalendar?</a>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a> is a standard for calendar data exchange.  It is supported by a large number of products, such as Apple iCal and Google Calendar.  The DSS support two kinds of iCalendars - one that contains the entire GBT schedule and one that contains observations and reservations tailored to the observer.  The iCalendar link that contains the entire GBT schedule can be found on the 'GBT Schedule' page. The iCalendar link that contains your personalized observation and reservation information can be found on your 'My Home' page, which serves as your home page upon login to the DSS. To view any of the DSS iCalendars, you need to copy the calendar URL to the iCalendar application.  One way to do this is to right-click the <img src="/static/images/ical.gif" style="border: 0;" /> image and choose 'Copy Link Location'.  Next paste this URL into to your preferred application.  In this way, you will have 'subscribed' to the Calendar, and get the most recent changes automatically.  Unfortunately at this time, our iCalendar feeds do not work properly with iCalendar applications that do not support SSL (e.g. Google Calendar).  As examples, here are steps for doing this with two different applications:
            <ul>
              <li>
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Sunbird">Sunbird</a>
                <ul>
                  <li>Right click on 'Calendar' (on the left-hand side), and choose 'New Calendar'.  </li>
                  <li>In the wizard that appears, choose 'On Network'. Click 'Next'.</li>
                  <li>On the next wizard page, cut and paste the URL you got from the ical icon to the text box.  Click 'Next'.</li>
                  <li>Give a name to this new calendar.  Click 'Finish'.</li>
                  <li>Your new calendar should appear in the 'Calendar' box, with the name you just gave it.  Right click it. Choose 'Reload Remote Calendars'.  This will retrieve the iCal from the DSS and display it in the Calendar View to the right.</li>
                  <li>You can then configure Sunbird to reload this calendar periodically, or retrieve it by hand.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOrganizer">KOrganizer</a>
                <ul>
                  <li>Go to the Calendar section in the bottom left-hand side, click 'Add...'</li>
                  <li>Choose Calendar in Remote File</li>
                  <li>In the 'Download From' text box, cut and paste the URL for your calendar's iCal.</li>
                  <li>Give a name to this new Calendar.</li>
                  <li>Back in the Calendar section, right click your new calendar and choose 'Reload Remote Calendars'.  This will retrieve the iCal from the DSS and display it in the Calendar View to the right.</li>
                  <li>You can then configure KOrganizer to reload this Calendar periodically, or retrieve it by hand.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a name="multipleBlackouts">Repeating Blackout Dates</a>
        <ul>
          <li>In addition to specifying a simple black out date, with a start and end date, you can also specify black out dates that repeat.  You can choose between daily, weekly and monthly recurring dates.
          </li>  
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a name="RemotelyQualified">How can I become qualified as a remote observer?</a>
        <ul>
          <li> Green Bank staff certify users as remote observers once the staff are satisfied that an observer is experienced enough to perform observations off-site. Observers are generally required to observe once at the Green Bank site. Full requirements and guidelines for remote observing are fully described in the <a href="http://www.gb.nrao.edu/gbt/remoteobserving.shtml">Remote Observing with the GBT</a> document.</li>
          <li> Students must visit Green Bank to be trained and qualified.  They may not be trained by advisors, off site.</li>
          <li> Observers who were qualified as remote observers before the implementation of the DSS are still considered qualified. At present there is no time limit placed on this status though observers using instruments or observing modes unfamiliar to them should plan to do the observations on site.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a name="NoQuestion">What if my question isn't on this FAQ?</a>
        <ul>
          <li>If you have a question that is not answered by the DSS Observers Introduction, the DSS <a href="http://www.gb.nrao.edu/dss/">webpage</a>, or this FAQ then please choose one of the following options
            <ul>
	          <li> For issues related directly to the science or hardware for your project, please contact your project friend. A list of project contacts can be found linked from the GBT homepage.
              </li>
              <li> If your issue relates directly to the DSS (e.g. scheduling or session parameters) please notify us via the <a href="https://help.nrao.edu">Support Center</a>.
